# Aghast

Aghast is a Quilt mod meant to fix Ghasts in multiplayer for Beta 1.7.3.

This mod fixes the following 2 Ghast-related issues:
- Ghasts don't make a sound when they shoot
- Ghasts do not have the model growth/shrink animation when shooting

The sound is played the way release 1.0 plays it, so it even helps clients that connect through a compatability layer, such as ViaFabricPlus!

The mod also fixes a crash, unrelated to Ghasts:
- The client crashes when trying to access the name of slabs that weren't meant to be obtained, but can be obtained through block transmutation
